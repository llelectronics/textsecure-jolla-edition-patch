# LibreSignal for Android

`LibreSignal` is the **Google-Free** fork of the original `Signal` messaging app for simple private communication with friends. `LibreSignal` uses your phone's data connection (WiFi/3G/4G) to communicate securely, optionally supports plain SMS/MMS to function as a unified messenger, and can also encrypt the stored messages on your phone. Featured on [Kuketz IT-Security Blog](https://www.kuketz-blog.de/?s=LibreSignal).

# WebSocket Support
For push notifications, Google Cloud Messaging has been completely replaced by WebSocket to directly connect to Open Whisper Systems's server.
It's done via a modified version of `libtextsecure`, which has been included as a submodule.
